    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>The story of piano instructor Gabriel started when he was but a young child. At the age of six years old,
        Gabriel began taking piano lessons under the direction of his father, who at that point was credited with creating some of
        the most beautiful symphonies the world has ever heard. Gabriel's father Bourgello, has worked with numerous celebrities,
        and you can even find some of his most revered songs on "Now that's a Symphnoy! Greatest hits Volume 2".

        After performing for several audiences throughout his early career, Gabriel then attended Berklee University
        and graduated with an M.M. in Piano Performance. He has since been busy assisting others with their careers
        while still performing at live venues all across the world.

        However, Gabriel has decided to take a break from live performances and is now more interested in teaching
        piano and the composition of symphonies to prospective students.</p>

<section id="Curriculum">
    <h1>Curriculum </h1>
    <p>During your first few lessons, an emphasis will be put on artistic skills, solo, and ensemble
        performances as well. To truly master the piano, Gabriel recommends that students receive private lessons
        with him at least 3 times a week. Gabriel also recommends that his students network with other students
        of different genres in their area. This includes attending live performances and gatherings at local
        conferences. The ability to meet with others and collaborate on performances is a large part
        of becoming a renowned professional and pianist. Therefore, Gabriel truly reinforces these virtues
        unto his students.. </p>
